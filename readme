The application works on most devices and browers (Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, FireFox, all iPhones, Samsung)
The player has one try to find each city from the list of cities, and 1500 km of distance to spend, when the list is empty, the user receives his/her result (How many cities got found and how many kilometres he didn't have to use to find the cities)

We could upgrade the app, by adding a timer. So when the game is over, the user recieves the information of how much time he spent finding the cities
